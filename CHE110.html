        </ul>
        <h2><u>Causes of Land Degradation:</u></h2>
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Deforestation</b>:
            <p>Forests play an important role in maintaining fertility of soil by shedding their leaves which contain many nutrients. Forests are also helpful in binding up of soil particles with the help of roots of vegetation. Therefore, cutting of forests will affect the soil adversely.</p></li>
            <li><b>Overgrazing</b>
            <p>Increase in livestock population results in overexploitation of pastures. Due to this, grass and other types of vegetation are unable to survive and grow in the area, and lack of vegetation cover leads to soil erosion. Millions of people in Africa and Asia raise animals on pastures and rangelands that have low carrying capacity because of poor quality or unreliable rainfall Pastoralists and their rangelands are threatened by overgrazing.</p></li>
            <li><b>Excessive Use of Fertilizers and Pesticides</b>:
            <p>Fertilizers are indispensable for increasing food production but their excessive use has occasioned much concern as a possible environmental threat. Excessive use of fertilizers is causing an imbalance in the quantity of certain nutrients in the soil. This imbalance adversely affects the vegetation.</p></li>
            <li><b>Industrialization</b>:
            <p>Development of industries for the economic growth of the country leads to excessive deforestation and utilization of land in such as way that it has lost its natural up gradation quality.</p></li>
            <li><b>Urbanization</b>:
            <p>Increasing growth of population and demand for more residential areas and commercial sectors is also one of the reasons for land degradation.</p></li>
            <li><b>Water-logging</b>: 
            <p>In the agriculture field when proper irrigation is not done or maintenance the drainage system lacks, then excessive waterlogging can happen. If this happens then the surface water and the groundwater gets mixed which will bring salt from the groundwater level, thus ruining the fertility of the land.</p></li>
            <li><b>Salination</b>: 
            <p>Increase in the concentration of soluble salts in the soil is called salination. India has about six million hectares of saline land. The ground water of arid regions are generally saline in nature. The irrigation water may be itself rich in soluble water and add to salinity of soils.Excess use of alkaline fertilizers like sodium nitrate, basic slag, etc. may develop alkalinity in soils.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2><u>Prevention and Control Measures for Land Degradation</u>:</h2>
        <pre>Following are some practises for controlling land degradation:</pre>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Strip farming</b>:
            <p>It is & practice in which cultivated crops are sown in alternative strips to prevent water movement.</p><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2Q3IpOZCGgY/UORNOQBOVvI/AAAAAAAAALY/N5JVX71Mqzk/s1600/ContourFarming.jpg" width="300px" height="300px"></li>
            <li><b>Crop Rotation</b>:
            <p>It is one of the agricultural practice in which different crops are grown in same area following a rotation system which helps in replenishment of the soil.</p></li>
            <li><b>Ridge and Furrow Formation</b>:
            <p>Soil erosion is one of the factors responsible for lad degradation. It can be prevented by formation of ridge and furrow during irrigation which lessens run off.</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.zsjF-fkFUmMtuGOMX3Y0VAHaGD?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" width="300px" height="300px"></li>
            <li><b>Construction of Dams</b>:
            <p>This usually checks or reduces the velocity of run off so that soil support vegetation.</p></li>
            <li><b>Contour Farming</b>:
            <p>This type of farming is usually practiced across the hill side and is useful in collecting and diverting the run off to avoid erosion."</p><img src="https://www.tractorjunction.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CONTOUR-FARMING.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" ></li>
        </ol>
        <H2><u>Awearness</u>:</H2>
            <p>Public awareness can play a significant role in the conservation of natural resources by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Raising awareness:</b><p>By educating the public on the importance and value of natural resources, they can be encouraged to support conservation efforts.</p></li>
            <li><b>Influencing behaviour:</b><p>When people are aware of the consequences of their actions on the environment, they can change their behaviour to reduce their impact on natural resources.</p></li>
            <li><b>Mobilizing support:</b><p>Raised public awareness can lead to increased support for conservation efforts and policies, helping to secure funding and political backing for conservation initiatives.</p></li>
            <li><b>Promoting sustainable practices:</b><p>Public awareness can help promote the adoption of sustainable practices, such as recycling, energy-saving measures, and responsible resource use, which can reduce the rate at which natural resources are depleted.</p></li>
            <li><b>Encouraging protection:</b><p>Raised public awareness can help increase support for the protection of critical habitats, wildlife and biodiversity, by highlighting the importance of preserving these resources for future generations."</p></li>
        </ul>
    <div style="background-color: skyblue;">
        <h2>CONCLUSION:</h2>
    </div>
    <p>We have a limited amount of resources but human needs are unlimited.<br>
For human beings land has many needs: it functions as an asset, produces food, stores water, has minerals for plant growth, and more.<br>
The land resource is not a renewable resource, as the demand for land increases with the increase of population, the amount of land will remain the same.<br>
Land use pattern is the layout or arrangement of the uses and purposes of the land.<br>
Climate, soil, the density of population, technical and socio-economic features determine the land use pattern.<br>
Forests, wasteland, cultivation, and civilization are the most important types of land use.<br>
Land use in civilization is the most exploited, roads, transport routes, housing, industries, and human settlement.<br>
